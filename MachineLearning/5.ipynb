    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your company is struggling with a series of computer virus attacks for the past several months. The viruses were grouped into a few types with some effort. However, it takes a long time to sort out what kind of virus it is when been hit with. Thus, as a senior IT department member, you undertook a project to classify the virus as quickly as possible. You've been given a dataset of the features that may be handy (or not), and  also the associated virus type (target variable). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are supposed to try different classification methods and apply best practices we have seen in the lectures such as grid search, cross validation, regularization etc. To increase your grade you can add more elaboration such as using ensembling or exploiting feature selection/extraction techniques. **An evaluation rubric is provided.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please prepare a python notebook that describes the steps, present the results as well as your comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the data (csv file) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxbibzUU8bjOyChDVFPfQ4viLduYdk29/view?usp=sharing).\n"
